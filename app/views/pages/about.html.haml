        Kiaora, I'm Rose Lu! <br> <br>

        I'm a Ruby on Rails developer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I've been working as a software developer since 2012, and have also been involved in community work with
        = link_to "Rails Girls", "http://railsgirls.com"
        and
        = link_to "Youthline.", "http://youthline.co.nz"
        <br> <br>

        I'm currently travelling around east Asia, doing some work for
        = link_to "Enspiral", "http://whatis.enspiral.com/"
        and meeting people involved in social enterprise, open source, and other cool projects. <br> <br>

        Outside of work I'm usually found cycling, yoga-ing, cooking and hanging out. <br> <br>

        You can follow me on
